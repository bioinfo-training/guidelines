#  BEST PRACTICES FOR DELIVERING BIOINFORMATICS TRAINING IN LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES

## Welcome to the project portal!

The project was established on August 2020 at the Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) session of the Bioinformatics Education Global Summit. A group of academics gathered to discuss educational topics of special interests to LMICs and started working on obtaining a Best Practices Guidlines that could be taken as reference for the design, organization and delivery of bioinformatics training in short format.

The guidelines are a living document, they keep evolving as new experiences and challenges arise. An opinion piece about the project is currently in review and the initial version of the guidelines is to be published in this portal in the near future as it is being finalized at the moment.
