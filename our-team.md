Passionate about improving accessibility to educational materials and resources and enhancing STEM capacity on the African continent.

### Patricia Carvajal-López, Editor. CABANA Project
Patricia is a Scientific Training Officer at the EMBL-EBI’s Training Team. She works on development and delivery of on-site courses and participates in several communities of practice, some which involve analyzing the current status of bioinformatics education in LATAM and bringing the Train the Trainer courses to the Spanish and Portuguese languages.

### Marco Cristancho, Contributor. CABANA Project/UNIANDES
Marco is an Associate Professor at the University of the Andes, Bogota, Colombia. With over 13 years of experience on Bioinformatics and more than 20 years of expertise in Genomics, Molecular Biology and coffee improvement, Marco’s leadership in bioinformatics in Colombia is well recognised. He has been involved in a large number of national and international collaborative endeavours and is an experienced leader of large projects and scientific groups. He advises in the areas of Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Plant Pathogens Control for public and private Research Institutes in Colombia and abroad. His current focus is the leadership of Bioinformatics Research Projects with high impact in Colombia in the areas of Health, Biodiversity and Agriculture.

### Piraveen Gopalasingam, Contributor. CABANA Project
Piv joined EMBL-EBI in 2017 as a Scientific Training Officer for the Training Team at EMBL-EBI and is primarily responsible for the scientific development and delivery of training within the CABANA project. He is a Train the Trainer instructor, and has an interest in science communication, community building, equality, diversity and inclusion.

### Selene Fernandez-Valverde, Contributor. CABANA Project/CINVESTAV-LANGEBIO
Selene L. Fernández Valverde is Principal Investigator of the Functional and Evolutionary Genomics of Regulatory RNA group at the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity in Mexico (Langebio-cinvestav). Her research focuses on genomics and bioinformatics. Her core academic interest is contributing to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the wide phenotypical diversity present in the animal and plant kingdom. She is particularly interested in the role of non-coding RNAs in the evolution of regulatory landscapes within and between species.

### Paballo Chauke, Contributor. H3ABioNet
I am a Bioinformatics Training and Outreach Coordinator for H3ABIONET- a Pan-African based program interested in studying genetic diseases in Africa. I mainly focus on training aspects of the project such as workshops, face to face and online Training and Education as well as Career Development, and I also work on the team's outreach.

### Alejandro Reyes Muñoz, Contributor. CABANA Project/UNIANDES 
Alejandro is a Microbiologist with an MSc in Biological Sciences from the Universidad de los Andes and a PhD in Computational and Systems Biology from Washington University in San Luis, MO, United States. His research interests include the application of computational biology to the development of tools for analysis of data derived from genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and metagenomic data for the characterisation of microbial communities and their interactions with the environment, including communities associated with humans and their health consequences. He leads the Master's in Computational Biology at UniAndes, and co-leads CABANA's eLearning activities.
